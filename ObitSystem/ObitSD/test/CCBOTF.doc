            CCB2OTF Convert GBT CCB data to OTF format FITS file
               -----------------------------------------

   CCB2OTF converts a GBT CCB (continuum) archive data file to an OTF
data set. Control input is from a user edited file.  One scan is added
to the output file per run.

Usage: CCB2OTF -input file [-scan date/time]
Convert an GBT CCB file format to Obit/OTF
Arguments:
  -input input parameter file, def CCB2OTF.in
  -scan date/time used for form scan FITS file names
        This is the string that forms the basename of the archive
        files.  The OTF data file should be constructed in time order;
        one way to do this is to use ls in the CCB directory to collect
        a time ordered list and then edit this into a shell script.



         CCB2OTF input file documentation

   This describes the input file format for CCB2OTF.
The input file is basically free format with a keyword=value syntax.  
Comments follow a "#" symbol.


   Entries not specified will assume their default values.  Parameters
may be given in any order but only the recognized parameters given below
are allowed. 

An example follows:
$Key = scan  Str (24)  # Date/time name of scan
2003_06_27_04:05:50# Data
$Key = outfile Str (48)
TestCbandOTF.fits
$Key = DataRoot Str (64)
../GCCband/AGBT02C_019_04/
$Key = doBS Boo (1)
T

 Variables possibly read from the input_file 
scan:   input scan name (from names of archive files).  This will be
        overridden by a command line value.
     type: string
     default: none
     example: 2003_06_27_01:39:57

DataRoot:  relative path for base of GBT archive directory structure.
           This points to the directory that contains the CCB, Antenna
           etc. subdirectories.
     default: none
     example: ../GCCband/AGBT02C_019_04/

outfile:   output FITS image file name, will go into FITSdata/.
     type: string
     default: OTFTable.fits

timeCorr:  Correction in sec. to add to GBT time labels
     type: double
     default: 0.0

doBS:      If True then form beamswitched data with 1 state, otherwise
           total power data with 4 states.
     type: boolean
     default: T

dataNorm:  Normalization factor per detector/state.  This is needed
           to get all the data on the same scale when doBS is True.
           Values in OTF order rather than GBT.
     type: float array, one value per detector/state (usually 64)
     default: 1.0,  if a single value is given, use for all
