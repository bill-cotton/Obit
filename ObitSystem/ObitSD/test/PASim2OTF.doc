               PASim2OTF Convert data to OTF format FITS file
               -----------------------------------------

   PASim2OTF Converts a Penn Array IDL simulator dataset to an OTF data set.
Control input is from a user edited file.

         PASim2OTF input file documentation

   This describes the input file format for PASim2OTF.
The input file is basically free format with a keyword=value syntax.  
Comments follow a "#" symbol.


   Entries not specified will assume their default values.  Parameters
may be given in any order but only the recognized parameters given below
are allowed. 

An example follows:
# input file for PASim2OTF
geom  = somefile.text with array geometry
data  = somefile.text with data
outfile = !OTFtable.fits # the ! allows overwrite

/* variables possibly read from the input_file */
data:  text file with data
     type: string
     default: PennArray.dat
   The format is one "Penn Array" readout per line.  in order on each line:
     *detector outputs 1...64
     *central RA (deg)
     *central Dec (deg)
     *"cal on" flag (1 or 0)
     *timestamp in seconds (arbitrary offset zeroed on a *per scan*
      basis)
     *the array rotation in degrees (expressed as a parallactic angle)

geom:  text file with array geometry
     type: string
     default: PennArray.geom
   This file is a fixed output. Each line has the azimuth and
   elevation of detector N in degrees as an offset from the fiducial
   central position which is reported in the .raw file.  Line one of this
   file is N=1; line two is N=2; etc.

outfile:   output FITS image file name
     type: string
     default: PASimOTF.fits
