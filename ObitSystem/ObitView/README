   ObitView is a viewer for for Obit of FITS format and other images
for unix/X-Windows systems.  ObitView will display images allowing
zooming, scrolling, modifying the brightness, contrast and color and
allow determination of celestial positions in the image.  Positions
and brightnesses of selected pixels may be logged to a text file.
Specified positions in the image may be marked.  Images may be
compared by "blinking" them and 3 dimensional images may be viewed in
the form of a movie.  The program contains extensive online
documentation.  Blanked pixels and all defined FITS image data types
are supported.  Normal or gzip compressed files may be used.

 Installation
 ------------
   
    Installation of ObitView requires an ansi c compiler and the
Motif package of software for the X-Windows system (not included in
this distribution).  If Motif is not available on your system, LessTif
is a freeware alternative (ftp://ftp.hungry.com/pub/hungry/lesstif/).
You must install Motif (and X-windows) before installing ObitView.
To install:

gtar xzvf obitview??.tgz
cd ObitView
./configure
make

and this should build the executable XFITSview.  Move this to somewhere 
in your path ($PATH).  If this procedure doesn't work, the most likely reason 
is that the MOTIF directories weren't located. If the libraries are in a
nonstandard place then you must tell configure must tell with command line 
options:
  --with-motif=DIR        search for MOTIF in DIR/include and DIR/lib
  --with-motif-includes=DIR

Some influential environment variables for configure:
  CC          C compiler command
  CFLAGS      C compiler flags
  LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
              nonstandard directory <lib dir>
  CPPFLAGS    C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if you have
              headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
  CPP         C preprocessor

Usage
-----

   ObitView may be started with the name of a FITS format file as a
command line argument.  Either the initial or subsequent files may be
selected using the "Open" item in the "File" menu.  Consult the "Help
Me" item in the "Help" menu for further details.  Each menu column has
a separate help item.
