Writing XML-RPC servers in Python.

* What is passed in as a class, comes out as a dictionary.

* You can't return None.  Since that's exactly what Pytrhon does if
  you omit the return statement from a function, be sure to explicitly
  return something.  My suggestion is returning True to indicate
  things worked out as expected.
