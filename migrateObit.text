Instructions for migrating a working Obit from source

   The principal Obit repository has been moved from an NRAO
subversion server to GitHub.  The Obit on the NRAO server has been
frozen and the new server is at URL
https://github.com/bill-cotton/Obit. 
The GitHub server is intrinsically a git repository but has a really
credible subversion emulation; also git updates require a password and
svn doesn't.  The following describes how to migrate from the NRAO
server to GitHub after which the previous subversion comands should
still work.

   If your current installation of Obit works, you have a choice of
installing the new version and 1) going through the configure/build
process, or 2) copying the relevant Makefiles, scripts, third party
software, etc and changing path names.  The following describes the
latter.  Examples in the following are given in tcsh and can be cut
and pasted into a tcsh unix shell.

First you need to checkout a version of Obit from GitHub, cd to where
you want it installed.  Note: DO NOT delete your old version before
finishing the migration.  Subversion checkout is by:
> svn co https://github.com/bill-cotton/Obit
This will create an Obit directory tree starting with Obit/trunk
In the following $OBITOLD points to your old version of Obit, e.g.
> setenv OBITOLD /export/ssd/bcotton/SVN/ObitInstall/
and $OBITNEW to the trunk directory, e.g.
> setenv OBITNEW /export/raid_2/bcotton/GitObit/Obit/trunk/

In the top directory are the scripts and the "other" directory with
third party software.  If your current build uses software from the
other directory tree, copy the relevant directories:

cp -p -r $OBITOLD/other/include $OBITNEW/other/include 
cp -p -r $OBITOLD/other/lib $OBITNEW/other/lib
cp -p -r $OBITOLD/other/bin $OBITNEW/other/bin
cp -p -r $OBITOLD/other/man $OBITNEW/other/man
cp -p -r $OBITOLD/other/share $OBITNEW/other/share

The first two are the most critical.  If none exist then you're
unlikely to be using them.

The following steps need a macro that uses sed to change directory
names in files,  the following changes the string in $OBITOLD to the
one in $OBITNEW, create one for your case

setenv rename "sed s#$OBITOLD#$OBITNEW#g"

Then

cp -p -r $OBITOLD/opt $OBITNEW/opt
cp -p -r $OBITOLD/bin $OBITNEW/bin

several of the scripts in the bin directory (ObitTalk, ObitTalkServer)
need  internal changes to point to the new directories.  You can use
this macro to modify any of your setup scripts.

$rename $OBITOLD/bin/ObitTalk > $OBITNEW/bin/ObitTalk
$rename $OBITOLD/bin/ObitTalkServer > $OBITNEW/bin/ObitTalkServer

Then work on the ObitSystem directory.

cp -p -r $OBITOLD/ObitSystem/doc $OBITNEW/ObitSystem/doc 

It's not critical that this exists.

# ObitSystem/ObitView
$rename $OBITOLD/ObitSystem/ObitView/Makefile > $OBITNEW/ObitSystem/ObitView/Makefile
$rename $OBITOLD/ObitSystem/ObitView/src/Makefile > $OBITNEW/ObitSystem/ObitView/src/Makefile

# ObitSystem/ObitTalk
$rename  $OBITOLD/ObitSystem/ObitTalk/Makefile > $OBITNEW/ObitSystem/ObitTalk/Makefile
$rename  $OBITOLD/ObitSystem/ObitTalk/bin/Makefile > $OBITNEW/ObitSystem/ObitTalk/bin/Makefile
$rename  $OBITOLD/ObitSystem/ObitTalk/doc/Makefile > $OBITNEW/ObitSystem/ObitTalk/doc/Makefile
$rename  $OBITOLD/ObitSystem/ObitTalk/config.status > $OBITNEW/ObitSystem/ObitTalk/config.status

# ObitSystem/Obit
$rename $OBITOLD/ObitSystem/Obit/Makefile > $OBITNEW/ObitSystem/Obit/Makefile
$rename $OBITOLD/ObitSystem/Obit/src/Makefile > $OBITNEW/ObitSystem/Obit/src/Makefile
$rename $OBITOLD/ObitSystem/Obit/tasks/Makefile > $OBITNEW/ObitSystem/Obit/tasks/Makefile
$rename $OBITOLD/ObitSystem/Obit/python/Makefile > $OBITNEW/ObitSystem/Obit/python/Makefile
$rename $OBITOLD/ObitSystem/Obit/dummy_cfitsio/Makefile > $OBITNEW/ObitSystem/Obit/dummy_cfitsio/Makefile
$rename $OBITOLD/ObitSystem/Obit/dummy_xmlrpc/Makefile > $OBITNEW/ObitSystem/Obit/dummy_xmlrpc/Makefile
cp -p -r $OBITOLD/ObitSystem/Obit/python/python.swg $OBITNEW/ObitSystem/Obit/python/python.swg

# Any special Makefiles needed for AVX, GPUs etc also should be copied

# ObitSystem/ObitSD
$rename $OBITOLD/ObitSystem/ObitSD/Makefile > $OBITNEW/ObitSystem/ObitSD/Makefile
$rename $OBITOLD/ObitSystem/ObitSD/src/Makefile > $OBITNEW/ObitSystem/ObitSD/src/Makefile 
$rename $OBITOLD/ObitSystem/ObitSD/tasks/Makefile > $OBITNEW/ObitSystem/ObitSD/tasks/Makefile
$rename $OBITOLD/ObitSystem/ObitSD/python/Makefile > $OBITNEW/ObitSystem/ObitSD/python/Makefile
$rename $OBITOLD/ObitSystem/ObitSD/test/Makefile > $OBITNEW/ObitSystem/ObitSD/test/Makefile
cp -p -r $OBITOLD/ObitSystem/ObitSD/python/python.swg $OBITNEW/ObitSystem/ObitSD/python/python.swg

Any special Makefiles needed for AVX, GPUs etc also should be copied

After these steps a "make clean all" should rebuild the system and
"svn update" can be used for subsequent updates.
