   This distribution allows the installation of Obit software for
processing astronomical (primarily radio) data.  The Obit package
relies on third party software and consists of a number of components.
The bulk of the third party software is included here and is built and
installed by included scripts. 
   The components of the Obit system are 1) the Obit libraries and
tasks (in c), 2) ObitView image display, 3) ObitTalk and
interactive python interface, and 4) ObitSD for single dish (GBT)
processing.  Obit and friends use AIPS and FITS files as native data 
types and is highly interoperable with AIPS. 
   Necessary software not included are X-windows and gmake.  Optional
software not included are pgplot (licensing restrictions) and
wxPython.  Software distributed here will be installed privately and
should not interfere with existing versions of packages (except
possibly as a side effect of setting $LD_LIBRARY_PATH or $PATH).

   The first step of installation is to move and unpack the 
distribution tarball, e.g.:
 > gtar xzvf ObitInstall2.1.tgz
or, if gtar is not available
 > gunzip ObitInstall2.1.tgz
 > tar xvf ObitInstall2.1.tar
This will leave the installation under subdirectory ObitInstall
The installation scripts are in, and should be run from subdirectory 
ObitInstall.

   Third party and Obit software are built and installed using the
InstallObit.sh script.  If you already have some of the distributed
third party packages installed, the reinstallation can be omitted
using command line -without options to InstallObit.sh;  -help gives:
    Build Obit software
    Third party software may be deselected with -without and any of
    the  following to use a version of the package installed in a
    standard place 
	    CFITSIO - FITS library
	    GLIB    - GNU extensions to c
	    FFTW    - Fourier transform package (version 2 (float) or 3)
	    GSL     - GNU Scientific Library
	    ZLIB    - Compression library
	    MOTIF   - Motif graphics library
	    PYTHON  - Python
	    WWW     - Internet protocol library - best to avoid this one
	    CURL    - Internet URL library (only one of WWW or CURL needed)
	    XMLRPC  - XMLRPC network protocol library
    
	    Select Obit options
	    THIRD - don't (re) install third party software
	    Obit  - don't (re) install Obit
	    ObitSD- don't (re) install ObitSD (single dish)
	    ObitView - don't (re) install ObitView
	    ObitTalk - don't (re) install ObitTalk

   For example, to install without using the included version of
Motif, python and GNU Scientific library:
 > InstallObit.sh -without MOTIF PYTHON GSL

   Interprocess communications in Obit uses the xmlrpc protocol.  In
the c implementation, this uses the xmlrpc-c library which in turn,
depends on other packages for the actual communications. Xmlrpc-c can
use either libwww or the curl package and both are distributed here.
Libwww is not thread-safe so curl is greatly preferred.  The WWW option
has been disabled in InstallObit.sh.

   To use the installed software, you have to tell your system where
to look for it.  If you've installed it in a directory whose path is
given by $ObitSystem (the ObitInstall directory), then you need to append 
$ObitSystem/other/lib to your $LD_LIBRARY PATH, e.g.
for csh
 > setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "$LD_LIBRARY PATH:$ObitSystem/other/lib"
for sh
 % LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY PATH:$ObitSystem/other/lib"; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
If this order picks up an incompatible library, prepend the Obit/other/lib but 
beware of potential problems with other software.

Similarly, you need to add $ObitSystem/bin to your $PATH
for csh
 > setenv PATH "$PATH:$ObitSystem/bin"
for sh
 % PATH="$PATH:$ObitSystem/bin"; export PATH

   In order to run ObitTalk, the environment variables $OBIT and $OBITSD (if installed)
need to be set:
for csh
 > setenv OBIT "$ObitSystem/ObitSystem/Obit"
 > setenv OBITSD "$ObitSystem/ObitSystem/Obit"
for sh
 % OBIT="$ObitSystem/ObitSystem/Obit"; export OBIT
 % OBITSD="$ObitSystem/ObitSystem/ObitSD"; export OBITSD

   In order to run Obit software from python without using ObitTalk, 
you need to set PYTHONPATH:
for csh
 > setenv PYTHONPATH "$PYTHONPATH:$OBITSD/python:$OBIT/python:$ObitSystem/opt/share/obittalk/python"
for sh
 % PATHPYTHON="$PYTHONPATH:$OBITSD/python:$OBIT/python:$ObitSystem/opt/share/obittalk/python"; export PATH

   The InstallObit.sh script creates a pair of setup files with the
commands to set the relevant environment parameters.  These are
setup.sh for sh (or bash) and setup.csh for csh (or tcsh).  The
appropriate file should be sourced before running Obit software.

   User documentation for ObitTalk can be found in
ObitSystem/doc/ObitTalk.pdf.  The most recent documentation is available
from the Obit home page http://www.cv.nrao.edu/~bcotton/Obit.html.

   Updates can be obtained using the Obit anonymous svn server.  Such an
update is recommended when installing this tarball as it is only updated 
occasionally. 
To update ObitSystem, cd to the ObitSystem top directory 
($OBITINSTALL/ObitSystem as defined in the setup scripts created by 
the installation) and :
 % svn update

64 bit Notes
------------
   The distributed (most recent) version of zlib doesn't build a shared
library or generate code that can be linked with.  If your systen has
a libz - then use it and specify -without ZLIB to InstallObit.sh
   The distributed Motic doesn't appear to build correctly on a 64 bit 
system.
