   Installing and running binary distribution of Obit

1) Unpack the distribution tarball in the directory in which you wish
   to install it; e.g.
 > mv obit-1.1.166-4.tar.gz /home/mydir/obitinstall
 > cd /home/mydir/obitinstall
 > tar zxf obit-1.1.166-4.tar.gz

2) Add the top level distribution to your path:
 > setenv PATH "/home/mydir/obitinstall/obit-1.1.166-4:$PATH"
if you use tcsh or, for bash
 > PATH="/home/mydir/obitinstall/obit-1.1.166-4:$PATH"; export PATH
You may wish to add these to your .cshrc or .profile login files.

3) ObitTalk is the python based user interface, documentation is in
doc/ObitTalk.pdf.

4) Additional customization is possible using the python file
dot.obitrc.py renamed to .obitrc.py and placed in your home directory
($HOME) or in the working directory from which you run ObitTalk.
This can be used to define the location of AIPS and AIPS data
directories as well as FITS data directories.
