                    Obit Astronomy Software

This software is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

   This distribution allows the installation of Obit software for
processing astronomical (primarily radio) data.  The Obit package
relies on third party software and consists of a number of components.
The installation process will download the third party software from
NRAO servers so will require internet access.
   The components of the Obit system are 1) the Obit libraries and
tasks (in c), 2) ObitView image display, 3) ObitTalk and
interactive python interface, and 4) ObitSD for single dish (GBT)
processing.  Obit and friends use AIPS and FITS files as native data 
types and is highly interoperable with AIPS. 
   Necessary software not included are X-windows and gmake.  Optional
software not included are pgplot (licensing restrictions) and
wxPython.  Software distributed here will be installed privately and
should not interfere with existing versions of packages (except
possibly as a side effect of setting $LD_LIBRARY_PATH or $PATH).

   The first step of installation is obtain a version of the software
from the subversion server, e.g.:
 > svn checkout https://svn.cv.nrao.edu/svn/ObitInstall/StableReleases/Obit-20JAN09

This will leave the installation under subdirectory Obit-20JAN09
The installation scripts are in, and should be run from subdirectory 
ObitInstall.  Distributions under the StableReleases tree are thought
to be relatively robust and only bug fixes will be applied to them

   Third party and Obit software are built and installed using the
InstallObit.sh script.  If you already have some of the provided
third party packages installed, the reinstallation can be omitted
using command line -without options to InstallObit.sh;  -help gives:
    Build Obit software
    Third party software may be deselected with -without and any of
    the  following to use a version of the package installed in a
    standard place 
	    CFITSIO - FITS library
	    GLIB    - GNU extensions to c
	    FFTW    - Fourier transform package (version 2 (float) or 3)
	    GSL     - GNU Scientific Library
	    ZLIB    - Compression library
	    MOTIF   - Motif graphics library
	    PYTHON  - Python
	    CURL    - Internet URL library
	    XMLRPC  - XMLRPC network protocol library
    
	    Select Obit options
	    THIRD - don't (re) install third party software
	    Obit  - don't (re) install Obit
	    ObitSD- don't (re) install ObitSD (single dish)
	    ObitView - don't (re) install ObitView
	    ObitTalk - don't (re) install ObitTalk

   For example, to install without using the provided version of
Motif, python and GNU Scientific library:
 > InstallObit.sh -without MOTIF PYTHON GSL

   To use the installed software, you have to tell your system where
to look for it.   The InstallObit.sh script creates a pair of setup
files in the same directory with the commands to set the relevant
environment parameters.  These are setup.sh for sh (or bash) and
setup.csh for csh (or tcsh). The appropriate file should be sourced
before running Obit software. 

   User documentation for ObitTalk can be found in
ObitSystem/doc/ObitTalk.pdf.  The most recent documentation is available
from the Obit home page http://www.cv.nrao.edu/~bcotton/Obit.html.

   Updates for bug fixes can be obtained using the Obit anonymous svn server.
To update ObitSystem, cd to the Obit top directory 
($OBITINSTALL as defined in the setup scripts created by 
the installation) and :
 % svn update

64 bit Notes
------------
   The distributed (most recent) version of zlib doesn't build a shared
library or generate code that can be linked with.  If your systen has
a libz - then use it and specify -without ZLIB to InstallObit.sh
   The distributed Motif doesn't appear to build correctly on a 64 bit 
system.
   The distributed glib causes all messages to br repeated but
otherwise appears functional.
